To avoid this warning, increase the display limit per unique message by
using the set_message -limit <number> command.
The message limit can be removed by using the set_message -no_limit command.
Note that setting a very large number using the set_message -limit command
or removing the message limit using the set_message -no_limit command can
significantly increase the log file size.
To suppress a message, use the set_message -suppress command.
